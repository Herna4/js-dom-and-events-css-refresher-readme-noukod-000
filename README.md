# Introduction to CSS

## Objectives

1. Describe how the different selectors look
2. Explain selector specificity
3. Explain how styles are applied to the DOM (i.e., what does ""cascading"" mean?)

## Outline

This is one of those "pulling back the curtain" lessons, where we show that the inline styles that had been used up to this point are in fact able to abstracted into proper CSS.

We mainly want to drill students in selector specificity -- we can point them to resources for specific style props.
